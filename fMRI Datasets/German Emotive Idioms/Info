This study investigated processing of idiomatic vs literal sentences during silent reading. 
Participants were asked to read sentences silently for comprehension and no response was required. 
Occasional comprehension questions required yes/no answers to make sure participants were engaging.

The study was divided in three consecutive runs or scanning sessions. 
After scanning, participants' knowledge of idioms was tested. 

Individual unknown idioms for individual participants (reported under phenotype) were excluded from the analyses.
