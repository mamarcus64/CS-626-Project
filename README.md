All of the processed data is already available in the `emotive_idioms_dataset/processed_data` folder. However, for reproducibility purposes, we have kept the code for generating these values. If you want to generate these values yourself, then:

1. download german emotive idioms from https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002727/versions/1.0.2 into folder `emotive_idioms_dataset/raw_data`
2. run the scripts in data_preprocessing
3. the processed data should automatically populate into `emotive_idioms_dataset/processed_data`
